Create a CLI tool in Python with uv, for infinitely listening to Slack and run claude-code based on Slack message. 

# System Daemon
1. It should be run by `uv` anywhere in the system. Thus create a symlink to ~/.local/bin
2. It should register as a daemon in macOS using launchctl
3. The CLI should provide commands to install/uninstall/restart the daemon
4. The CLI should provide command to show the location of the daemon log

# Slack Integration
1. The CLI shall run as a Slack app that can listen to incoming message (using Socket mode) as well as sending messgaes.
2. Create me a detailed documentation on how to setup the Slack app
3. Create an .env.template to ask for all credentials you need for the Slack integration

# Claude-Code Handling
- When the app receives an incoming Slack message, it run Claude Code `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions` with the slack message as the prompt. 
- It replies the Slack in **Slack Thread** of the output of Claude Code
- When receiving Slack **thread response**, the tool shall try to resume the corresponding Claude Code session (with -p --dangerously-skip-permissions) and append the Slack response as the next prompt. 

# Testing
Test the daemon and Claude-Code handling works by simulating Slack actions through CLI.

# Commit
Create .gitignore and make git commits.
